# 02---JS-and-CSS-Clock

Hello,world.

I started studying programming 3 moths ago(since 2020/11/19).

And, I'm challenging JavaScript Challenge on Youtube Channel of Wes Bos.

It's my challenge rule.ðŸ”½

1: It is OK to using a starter-kit preparing by Wes Bos.(Thank you Wes)

2: But I have to codeing by myself. I don't watch Youtube Channel.

If you interested in challenge, you should check the Wes Bos Youtube Channel.

This is Day's 2(Analog Clock Challenge)

But this challenge is difficult for me.

So, I should watched the Youtube Channel.
(Insted I created Degital Clock by myself. URL:https://github.com/Zan-Hiro/SimpleDesitalClock)


Finally, I am Japanese.

So I am not English well.

If you don't make sence my words, I'm sorry.

Thank you & happy coding!!
